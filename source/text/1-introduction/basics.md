# But firstâ€¦

It has been a couple of months since you completed your CS1 course, so let's review some concepts from last semester.

While Python and Typescript (and many other languages) are different, the basic concepts we learned in CS1 are still valid.

Concepts such as variables, operators, functions, conditionals and looping might have different syntax, but largely operate in the same way between languages.

If you understand the basic concepts, picking up a new language like Typescript is easier.  This is a critical skill as new languages and paradigms come into fashion all the time.  Learning how to apply your core knowledge to a new situation is critical to stay current throughout your career as a Computer Scientist.
