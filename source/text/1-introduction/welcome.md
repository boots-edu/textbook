Welcome to our textbook!

# Welcome to CISC181

* What is this course about?
  * In this course we will continue to study the field of Computer Science delving deeper into core concepts and introducing new concepts and paradigms for producing well engineered software solutions
  * Specifically, we will study Objects and Object\-Oriented programming techniques as well as various structures and algorithms to promote good software design.

# CISC181 Details

This semester, the course will be taught in Typescript.  Typescript is a free and open\-source programming language that adds static typing and type annotations to Javascript.

Typescript is used widely and has become the most common language for developing applications for the web.

Through labs, activities, and programming assignments you will become familiar with the Typescript language and developing well engineered software solutions.

# Policies and Procedures

The course will have lectures (2 or 3 per week depending on your section) as well as weekly lab periods.  Attendance at lectures is required.

Attendance at the weekly lab periods is mandatory unless you have completed the weeks assignment and received a grade above 90%.

Weekly assignments will be released on Sunday and be due the following Sunday.

There will be no extensions for weekly assignments.  To deal with special circumstances, the lowest 2 grades for weekly assignments will be dropped from the final grade.  You must do all of the assignments regardless.

# Additional Policies

Your overall course grade cannot be more than one letter grade higher than your average exam grade.  If your average exam grade is a C+, you cannot receive a grade above B+ for the course.

In order to pass the class, you must pass the last exam of the semester (there will be 3 total).

In order to pass the class, you must receive a passing grade on the final project.

Final course grades will be assigned at the discretion of the instructor.  Automatically assigned grades can be changed at any time at the instructor's discretion.

# Getting help

* We have many Teaching Assistants for this course.  Each will maintain office hours throughout the semester.  Contact and office hour information will be posted to the canvas site.
* Your faculty instructor will also have office hours throughout the semester to assist.
* IF YOU ARE HAVING AN ISSUE, GET HELP SOONER RATHER THAN LATER!!!
  * This course is additive, and if you fall behind, you will have difficulty with later concepts and assignments.

# ChatGPT and Co-Pilot

* For this course, use of these tools will not be allowed.  Using these tools will be considered as academic dishonesty and dealt with accordingly.
* This is not an arbitrary decision:
  * These tools, while impressive, are imperfect and often generate poor, inefficient, or downright incorrect code.  In order to use these tools, one must already know how to program well in order to be certain that the generated code is correct.
  * In some cases, these tools may not be available, and thus it is important to learn to work without it.
* Once you achieve mastery, you may be able to use these tools in future courses.  When used correctly they are powerful, but incorrectly they are dangerous.

# Semester Schedule

* There will be 3 exams this semester, each of equal weight.
  * First Exam during the 4th week of the semester
  * Second Exam during the 10th week of the semester
  * Third Exam during the 14th week of the semester
* There will be a final project which should start around week 11.

# Final Thoughts before we begin

Computer Science is hard until it is not.  Be patient with yourself and get help early if you need it.  The TA's and instructors are here to help you learn, we do not expect you to know it already.

We are not "scary" or a "last resort".  Visiting office hours is a normal part of the learning process.

We will have a discord channel for the course.  TA's will monitor the discord channel, but communication with the instructor should be through email.  Please be kind and respectful when communicating on Discord.

Office hours are blocked so we can be available.  If you need help outside these times, just ask the TA or instructor to schedule an appointment.   __We are here to help.__
