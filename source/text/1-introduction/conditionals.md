# Key Idea

A  __conditional__  is a way to alter program flow based on the value (truthiness) of some boolean expression.

# The `if` Statement

In typescript, the most common conditional is the  __`if`__ statement.

* The `if` statement evaluates a __conditional__ (or __logical__) expression and executes the code inside the `if` statement only _if_ that expression is `true`.
* The `if` statement can have an `else` branch. The `else` branch is only executed if the expression evaluates to `false`.

Using `if` statements we can execute different code based on the values of variables at run time, allowing us to create programs that are reactive to different states as the program runs.

# Example of an `if` Statement

```typescript
let year = "freshman";

if (year !== "senior") {
    console.log("You must register for classes");
}
```

Consider the case of a program that asks the user their year.
* If they are not a senior, the program registers them for next semester.
* If they are a senior then the program does nothing.

```typescript
let year = "senior";

if (year !== "senior") {
    console.log("You must register for classes");
}
```

# Example of an `if` Statement with an `else` Branch

Now suppose instead of doing nothing special when the user enters senior, we want to send them an invitation to graduation.
We can handle this with an  __`else`__ branch on our `if` statement.

```typescript
let year = "senior";

if (year !== "senior") {
    console.log("You must register for classes");
} else {
    console.log("Come to graduation");
}
```

# Nesting `if` inside of Functions

We can also nest `if` statements inside of functions.

```typescript
/**
 * Register for classes if not a senior
 * @param year The year of the student
 * @returns A message to the student
 */
function registerForClasses(year: string): string {
    if (year !== "senior") {
        return "You must register for classes";
    } else {
        return "Come to graduation";
    }
}

test("Test registerForClasses", () => {
    expect(registerForClasses("freshman")).toBe("You must register for classes");
    expect(registerForClasses("senior")).toBe("Come to graduation");
});
```

# Comparison Operators for Equality and Ordering

As a reminder, there are six main comparison operators in TypeScript:

* Equality:
  * `X === Y`: `true` if `X` and `Y` are equal
  * `X !== Y`: `true` if `X` and `Y` are not equal
* Ordering:
  * `X < Y`: `true` if `X` is less than `Y`
  * `X > Y`: `true` if `X` is greater than `Y`
  * `X >= Y`: `true` if `X` is greater than or equal to `Y`
  * `X <= Y`: `true` if `X` is less than or equal to `Y`

All of these operators are comparison operators, but they are also either equality operators or ordering operators.

# Boolean Operators

We can use Boolean operators to combine boolean expressions:
* __and__ (`&&`): true when both conditions are true
* __or__ (`||`): true when at least one of the conditions is true, and also when both are true

```typescript
let happiness: number = 8;
let luckiness: number = 9;

let happyLucky: boolean = (happiness >= 7 && luckiness > 7);
// Sets happyLucky to true when both conditions are true

let happyOrLucky: boolean = (happiness >= 7 || luckiness > 7);
// Sets happyOrLucky to true when at least one of the conditions is true
```

Just think of this in words:
* A and B implies both.
* A or B implies either.

# The Not Operator (`!`)

An additional Boolean operator that we have available is the not (`!`) operator (also called the __negation operator__).
Unlike the other operator, this operator simply negates whatever comes next.

* `!A && B`: `true` when `A` is `false` and `B` is `true`
* `!(A && B)`: `true` when at least one of `A` and `B` are `false`
* `!A || !B`: `true` when at least one of `A` and `B` are `false` (DeMorgan's Law)
* `!(A && B) || C`: `true` when at least one of `A` and `B` are `false` or any time `C` is `true`

By using a combination of comparison operators, logical connectors, and nots we can build complex logic to test state to use in conditionals and loopsâ€¦

# A Complex Example

```typescript
/**
 * Bring an umbrella if it is not raining
 * @param raining True if it is raining
 * @param temperature The temperature in degrees Fahrenheit
 * @returns A message to the user
 */
function bringUmbrella(raining: boolean, temperature: number): string {
    if (!raining && temperature < 70) {
        return "Bring an umbrella";
    } else if (raining && temperature < 70) {
        return "Bring an umbrella and a jacket";
    } else if (!raining && temperature >= 70) {
        return "No need for an umbrella";
    } else {
        return "No need for an umbrella, but bring a jacket";
    }
}

test("Test bringUmbrella", () => {
    expect(bringUmbrella(false, 60)).toBe("Bring an umbrella");
    expect(bringUmbrella(true, 60)).toBe("Bring an umbrella and a jacket");
    expect(bringUmbrella(false, 80)).toBe("No need for an umbrella");
    expect(bringUmbrella(true, 80)).toBe("No need for an umbrella, but bring a jacket");
});
```

# Summary

* An `if` statement is a way to alter program flow based on the value of some boolean expression. 
* An `else` branch can be added to an `if` statement to handle the case when the expression is `false`.
* We can use comparison operators to compare values and logical operators to combine multiple conditions. 
* An `if` statement can be nested inside of a function to create complex logic.
