Making web applications is super complicated, so we are going to be really pushy about your environment's setup and the eventual structure of our web application. If this seems limiting, that's the idea.

Please try to stay within the bounds we give you, as you experiment and try things out!

Do not skip steps.

Read error messages, and ask questions. Talk to humans as needed to get help, and use google intelligently.
