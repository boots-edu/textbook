Testing code is critical! In this chapter, we'll discuss how to write tests for your code, including both unit tests and integration tests. We'll also discuss how to use Jest, a popular testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript. This will also be an opportunity to discuss anonymous functions and how they can be used in testing.
