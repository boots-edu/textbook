Welcome to our textbook!

## Overview

* What is this text about?
  * In this text we will continue to study the field of Computer Science delving deeper into core concepts and introducing new concepts and paradigms for producing well engineered software solutions
  * Specifically, we will study ***Objects and Object-Oriented programming*** techniques as well as various structures and algorithms to promote good software design.

## Details

This text uses the language *Typescript*.  *Typescript* is a free and open-source programming language that adds static typing and type annotations to Javascript.

*Typescript* is used widely and has become the most common language for developing applications for the web.

Through this text and its associated materials you will become familiar with the *Typescript* language and developing well engineered software solutions.

## ChatGPT and Co-Pilot

* For this text, use of these tools is not recommended.
* This is not an arbitrary statement:
  * These tools, while impressive, are imperfect and often generate poor, inefficient, or downright incorrect code.  In order to use these tools, one must already know how to program well in order to be certain that the generated code is correct.
  * In some cases, these tools may not be available, and thus it is important to learn to work without them.
* Once you achieve mastery, you will be able to use these tools in the future.  

When used correctly they are powerful, but incorrectly they are dangerous.


## Final Thoughts before we begin

Computer Science is hard until it is not.  Be patient with yourself and be persistent.  You are at the beginning of the journey, and that is the hardest part.  As you work through this text, try to grasp the underlying concepts.
